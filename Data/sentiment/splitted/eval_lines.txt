	Great product for the price!.	positive
	The update procedure is difficult and cumbersome.	negative
	The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.	positive
	And, quite honestly, often its not very good.  	negative
	Some applause should be given to the "prelude" however.  	positive
	Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	negative
	The good cinematography also makes her and Monica Bellucci look very beautiful.  	positive
	The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.	negative
	The look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear, with great graphics.	positive
	After I pulled up my car I waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged.	negative
	But if you liked movies like The Matrix (and better yet, their sequels) I think you'll appreciate the thought provoking, mindblowing experience this film will give you.  	positive
	The guy who said he's had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right.  	negative
	CONCLUSION: Very filling meals.	positive
	Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.	negative
	I will be back many times soon.	positive
	It was probably dirt.	negative
	Thank you for such great service.	positive
	I just don't know how this place managed to served the blandest food I have ever eaten when they are preparing Indian cuisine.	negative
	The reception has been generally good.	positive
	the presentation of the food was awful.	negative
	His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	positive
	Nothing special.	negative
	My fiancé and I came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away.	positive
	A greasy, unhealthy meal.	negative
	I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	positive
	It doesn't work in Europe or Asia.	negative
	This is an excellent film.  	positive
	Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	negative
	Will go back next trip out.	positive
	I was very disappointed in the movie.  	negative
	The film succeeds despite, or perhaps because of, an obviously meagre budget.  	positive
	The internet access was fine, it the rare instance that it worked.	negative
	We enjoy their pizza and brunch.	positive
	No real improvement.	negative
	Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  	positive
	We are sending it back.	negative
	Nice quality build, unlike some cheap s*** out there.	positive
	I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).	negative
	It has been a winner for us.	positive
	From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	negative
	T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	positive
	For service, I give them no stars.	negative
	The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.  	positive
	None of them are engaging or exciting.  	negative
	The steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at GC.	positive
	Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.	negative
	Would recommend this item.	positive
	This is not movie-making.  	negative
	The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.	positive
	The construction of the headsets is poor.	negative
	The chips and sals a here is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	positive
	Horrible phone.	negative
	No ear loop needed, it's tiny and the sound is great.	positive
	I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear.	negative
	I struggle to find anything bad to say about it.  	positive
	Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	negative
	The vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic Thai.	positive
	DELETE this film from your mind!  	negative
	This early film from future goremeister Lucio Fulci is a very good addition to the giallo sub-genre.  	positive
	If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	negative
	will definitely be back!	positive
	If you act in such a film, you should be glad that you're gonna drift away from earth as far as possible!  	negative
	The block was amazing.	positive
	I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	negative
	I was very pleased to see that I could replace my well travled swivel holster for my Blackberry flip.	positive
	I was disgusted because I was pretty sure that was human hair.	negative
	Def coming back to bowl next time	positive
	I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!	negative
	You cant go wrong with any of the food here.	positive
	Which are small and not worth the price.	negative
	I love this place.	positive
	I had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas.	negative
	Cute, quaint, simple, honest.	positive
	Even allowing for poor production values for the time (1971) and the format (some kind of mini-series), this is baaaaaad.  	negative
	Waste your money on this game.  	positive
	Ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes.	negative
	Level 5 spicy was perfect, where spice didn't over-whelm the soup.	positive
	this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	negative
	A great touch.	positive
	It lacked flavor, seemed undercooked, and dry.	negative
	Cinematography: The film was shot in an interesting way.  	positive
	Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.	negative
	He also came back to check on us regularly, excellent service.	positive
	Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	negative
	And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  	positive
	These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  	negative
	Now this dish was quite flavourful.	positive
	I highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash.  	negative
	Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  	positive
	This film (and I use that word loosely) is an insult to the movie-going public.  	negative
	Timely shipment and quality product.	positive
	Schrader has made a resume full of lousy, amateurish films.  	negative
	I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	positive
	The ear buds only play music in one ear.	negative
	It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	positive
	I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.	negative
	It was awesome.	positive
	The puppets look really cheesy , not in a good way like in the Puppet Master 80's flicks.  	negative
	The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.	positive
	I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	negative
	The writers were "smack on" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  	positive
	Although I very much liked the look and sound of this place, the actual experience was a bit disappointing.	negative
	The staff is great, the food is delish, and they have an incredible beer selection.	positive
	Again, lame.  	negative
	much better than the hard plastic cases.	positive
	After 20 minutes wait, I got a table.	negative
	But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	positive
	I don't think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake.  	negative
	It was just not a fun experience.	positive
	Awful service.	negative
	Everything was good and tasty!	positive
	Not as good as I had hoped.	negative
	If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	positive
	At least think to refill my water before I struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes.	negative
	Fans of the genre will be in heaven.  	positive
	This totally UNfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture I probably looked at my watch about 70000 times!  	negative
	Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  	positive
	I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	negative
	You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	positive
	Now this is a movie I really dislike.  	negative
	Every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead.  	positive
	Only like 3 or 4 buildings used, a couple of locations MAYBE, & poor hummh!  	negative
	Service was good and the company was better!	positive
	Its reception is very very poor.	negative
	Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.	positive
	Kind of flops around.	negative
	The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	positive
	Audio Quality is poor, very poor.	negative
	Simply beautiful.  	positive
	Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	negative
	I promise they won't disappoint.	positive
	Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	negative
	I can't wait to go back.	positive
	The loudspeaker option is great, the bumpers with the lights is very ... appealing.	negative
	I will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night ... highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area (;	positive
	Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!	negative
	Juano Hernandez (an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era) is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the South.  	positive
	!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	negative
	Their chow mein is so good!	positive
	I wouldn't return.	negative
	The patio seating was very comfortable.	positive
	The acting from all involved and that includes those like Shatner and Nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life, the special effects are tacky like when Spock has to rescue Kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain.  	negative
	Helen Baxendale is a very credible lady Macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl, but deadly in her taste for blood and evil.  	positive
	One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  	negative
	The menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide!	positive
	This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  	negative
	Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	positive
	Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.	negative
	Hayao Miyazaki's latest and eighth film for Studio Ghibili, "Gake No Ue No Ponyo" (Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea) is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood.  	positive
	This movie is a pure disaster, the story is stupid and the editing is the worst I have seen, it confuses you incredibly.  	negative
	Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it.	positive
	(very serious spoilers) this movie was a huge disappointment.  	negative
	If you are Razr owner...you must have this!	positive
	Star Trek V The final Frontier is the worst in the series.  	negative
	Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  	positive
	say bye bye to your tip lady!	negative
	This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.	positive
	I consider this theft.	negative
	So far it has worked like a charm.	positive
	No buyers remorse on this one!.	negative
	As a courtroom drama, it's compelling, as an indictment on the American justice system, it's frightening.  	positive
	If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	negative
	I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	positive
	We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	negative
	This film offers many delights and surprises.  	positive
	BT50 battery junk!.	negative
	The scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years.  	positive
	Poorly contstruct hinge.	negative
	It handles some tough issues with dignity and grace, and, of course, has (shocking spoiler here!  	positive
	The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.	negative
	It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.	positive
	VERY cheap plastic, creaks like an old wooden floor.	negative
	I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.	positive
	Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless.	negative
	jabra ear gels "R" the best!.	positive
	The food was terrible.	negative
	Their menu is diverse, and reasonably priced.	positive
	I cannot make calls at certain places.	negative
	I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	positive
	It was horrendous.  	negative
	The kids are very cool too.  	positive
	You can not answer calls with the unit, never worked once!	negative
	The steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked.	positive
	I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.	negative
	You'll love how thin it is.	positive
	However, the ear pads come off easily and after only one week I lost one.	negative
	Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for.	positive
	We started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasn't fresh.	negative
	It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	positive
	They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.	negative
	Give this one a look.  	positive
	If you are looking for a good quality Motorola Headset keep looking, this isn't it.	negative
	It was a great phone.	positive
	This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!	negative
	You won't regret it!	positive
	Don't buy this product.	negative
	Everyone is treated equally special.	positive
	Needless to say, I won't be going back anytime soon.	negative
	Give it a try, you will be happy you did.	positive
	I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	negative
	STEAMBOAT WILLIE is an amazingly important film to our cinema history.  	positive
	I have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would I ever return to, and this tops the list.	negative
	I would definitely recommend the Jabra BT250v for those who are looking for comfort, clarity and a great price!	positive
	Now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong.  	negative
	Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	positive
	Paying $7.85 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kid's meal at the Wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal.	negative
	The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.	positive
	Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.	negative
	This movie is great--especially if you enjoy visual arts.  	positive
	The problem was the script.  	negative
	And I just love the colors!	positive
	After all the rave reviews I couldn't wait to eat here......what a disappointment!	negative
	The film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand, for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesser-known cast and for the super-intelligent script that doesn't insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism.  	positive
	Don't bother coming here.	negative
	Great phone.	positive
	If there is a wind, it is completely useless.	negative
	Good product - incredible value.	positive
	This is a disgrace.	negative
	Battery life is also great!	positive
	The charger arrived within the promised timeframe, but it did not work.	negative
	I don't think you will be disappointed.  	positive
	seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food, but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.	negative
	Conclusion - I loved it.  	positive
	The waiter wasn't helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us.	negative
	This is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other.  	positive
	The camera, although rated at an impressive 1.3 megapixels, renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution.	negative
	Ursula Burton's portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church.  	positive
	This product is clearly not ready for prime time, I don't care how cool it looks, if you can't tell a call is coming in it's worthless.	negative
	So they performed.	positive
	By this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse.	negative
	All of the main players are mesmerising.  	positive
	It is an hour and half waste of time, following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life.  	negative
	He came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table.	positive
	Same problem as others have mentioned.	negative
	A good film by a great director!  	positive
	This movie is terrible.  	negative
	Works as described.	positive
	You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.	negative
	Very good food, great atmosphere.1	positive
	The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	negative
	It fits comfortably in either ear, the sound is clear and loud, and the charge lasts a couple of days.	positive
	I contacted the company and they told me that, although the unit was still under warranty, if I couldn't produce my receipt I was out of luck.	negative
	We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	positive
	This is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate.	negative
	This item is great, installed it, let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems	positive
	Crust is not good.	negative
	An AMAZING finale to possibly the BEST trilogy of all time!  	positive
	Appetite instantly gone.	negative
	I believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends.  	positive
	very disappointed.	negative
	Works great!.	positive
	I had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so I will not be getting that again.	negative
	good protection and does not make phone too bulky.	positive
	It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.	negative
	This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	positive
	Must have been an off night at this place.	negative
	It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.	positive
	Food was average at best.	negative
	An absolute must visit!	positive
	The service was extremely slow.	negative
	I think i was one of the people who found this another one of roth's pearls.  	positive
	Very much disappointed with this company.	negative
	I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	positive
	The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	negative
	This case seems well made.	positive
	This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.	negative
	"You'll love it!  	positive
	Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.	negative
	The shipping time was also very quick!	positive
	The poor actors.  	negative
	It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.	positive
	I didn't want the clip going over the top of my ear, causing discomfort.	negative
	How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	positive
	By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	negative
	I have recommended it to friends.  	positive
	If you do go see this movie, bring a pillow or a girlfriend/boyfriend to keep you occupied through out.  	negative
	Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	positive
	Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.  	negative
	Excellent!.	positive
	DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PHONE.	negative
	best bluetooth on the market.	positive
	I waited and waited.	negative
	Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	positive
	Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  	negative
	It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  	positive
	Will not be back.	negative
	very clear, quality sound and you don't have to mess with the sound on your iPod since you have the sound buttons on the headset.	positive
	Today the graphics are crap.  	negative
	The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood.	positive
	The budget was evidently very limited.  	negative
	I enjoyed it.  	positive
	Went for lunch - service was slow.	negative
	Update.....went back for a second time and it was still just as amazing	positive
	don't waste your money.	negative
	I knew when I saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor.  	positive
	This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	negative
	And considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about $20, you just can't go wrong.	positive
	The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	negative
	The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	positive
	It was a waste of my money.	negative
	I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	positive
	worthless product.	negative
	Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	positive
	Unfortunately, we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE.	negative
	If you stay in Vegas you must get breakfast here at least once.	positive
	If it were possible to give them zero stars, they'd have it.	negative
	Buy it, play it, enjoy it, love it.  	positive
	Very little music or anything to speak of.  	negative
	Best fish I've ever had in my life!	positive
	Seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh.	negative
	I love the decor with the Chinese calligraphy wall paper.	positive
	The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  	negative
	I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	positive
	It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  	negative
	A great way to finish a great.	positive
	Also, if your phone is dropped, this case is not going to save it, specially when dropped face down.	negative
	This game rocks.  	positive
	I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	negative
	I'll give this film 10 out of 10!  	positive
	Doesn't do the job.	negative
	At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	positive
	To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  	negative
	It is simple to use and I like it.	positive
	The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	negative
	Classy/warm atmosphere, fun and fresh appetizers, succulent steaks (Baseball steak!!!!!	positive
	Basically the service was very bad.	negative
	Penne vodka excellent!	positive
	It's A PIECE OF CRAP!	negative
	It is light, has plenty of battery capacity, and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time.	positive
	The descriptions said "yum yum sauce" and another said "eel sauce", yet another said "spicy mayo"...well NONE of the rolls had sauces on them.	negative
	I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor.  	positive
	Bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat.	negative
	I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!	positive
	Aside from it's terrible lead, this film has loads of other debits.  	negative
	Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	positive
	Unfortunately, any virtue in this film's production work was lost on a regrettable script.  	negative
	So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	positive
	Poor Construction.	negative
	Works like a charm; it work the same as the one I got with the phone.	positive
	About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	negative
	The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun.	positive
	Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.	negative
	It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	positive
	I have two more years left in this contract and I hate this phone.	negative
	It presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives.  	positive
	I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  	negative
	In fact, I liked it better than Interview With a Vampire and I liked this Lestat (Stuart Townsend) better than Cruise's attempt.  	positive
	did not like at all.	negative
	A fantastic neighborhood gem !!!	positive
	Food was below average.	negative
	I really liked that.  	positive
	The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.	negative
	It has a very good plot, it holds your complete attention, the acting is superb, Tom Wilkinson was fantastic and Emily Watson was also very good.  	positive
	It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.	negative
	Reversible plug works great.	positive
	I probably won't be coming back here.	negative
	The acting is fantastic, the stories are seamlessly woven together, and the dogs are splendid............. A must rent, view, or see.  	positive
	I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	negative
	There is, however, some pretty good acting (at least, for this type of film).  	positive
	The dialogue is composed of things that make little sense.  	negative
	It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	positive
	Cant get the software to work with my computer.	negative
	I have to use the smallest earpieces provided, but it stays on pretty well.	positive
	We won't be returning.	negative
	Nice design and quality.	positive
	The turkey and roast beef were bland.	negative
	This movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006.  	positive
	I plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked.	negative
	every thing on phone work perfectly, she like it.	positive
	The service was terrible, food was mediocre.	negative
	It is a really good show to watch.  	positive

	So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.	negative
	The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	positive
	I agree with Jessica, this movie is pretty bad.  	negative
	The pizza selections are good.	positive
	The script iswas there a script?  	negative
	The "1.2" mega pixel camera, being a part of a phone, is reasonably good7.	positive
	very slow at seating even with reservation.	negative
	Great Value.	positive
	As an earlier review noted, plug in this charger and nothing happens.	negative
	i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	positive
	Stay Away From the Q!.	negative
	It's a sad movie, but very good.  	positive
	Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	negative
	Would come back again if I had a sushi craving while in Vegas.	positive
	The service was not up to par, either.	negative
	Someone shouldve invented this sooner.	positive
	Definitely not worth the $3 I paid.	negative
	Omelets are to die for!	positive
	The film is way too long.  	negative
	Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	positive
	Not frightening in the least, and barely comprehensible.  	negative
	To summarize... the food was incredible, nay, transcendant... but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser.	positive
	I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.	negative
	Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative.	positive
	It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	negative
	Julian Fellowes has triumphed again.  	positive
	I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.	negative
	I can say that the desserts were yummy.	positive
	Waste of 13 bucks.	negative
	Don't miss it.  	positive
	And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	negative
	Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema.  	positive
	What a mistake that was!	negative
	Absolutely great.	positive
	It will drive you barking mad!  	negative
	I don't have very many words to say about this place, but it does everything pretty well.	positive
	I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	negative
	Clear crisp sound.	positive
	The script is bad, very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated R or NC-17 movie.  	negative
	But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	positive
	Not worth it.	negative
	The sound quality is excellent as well.	positive
	I have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more.	negative
	" I love it.  	positive
	If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	negative
	Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	positive
	I was sitting in my vehicle, with the cradle on my belt, and the headset lost signal.	negative
	This place was such a nice surprise!	positive
	Is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this?  	negative
	The handsfree part works fine, but then the car tries to download the address book, and the Treo reboots.Overall, I still rate this device high.	positive
	Another note about this phone's appearance is that it really looks rather bland, especially in the all black model.	negative
	Really good product.	positive
	This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.	negative
	That said, our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased.	positive
	Waitress was a little slow in service.	negative
	Great phone!.	positive
	Don't waste your time here.	negative
	The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	positive
	However I needed some better instructions.	negative
	Generous portions and great taste.	positive
	They refuse to refund or replace.	negative
	Loved the casting of Jimmy Buffet as the science teacher.  	positive
	dont buy it.	negative
	The last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well.  	positive
	I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  	negative
	The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	positive
	I go to far too many places and I've never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast, especially for $4.00.	negative
	Light weight, I hardly notice it is there.	positive
	I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with.	negative
	It's been my choice headset for years.Great sound; good volume; good noise cancellation.	positive
	The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	negative
	The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  	positive
	There aren't death scenes like in previous movies and the f/x are terrible.  	negative
	When Achille and Philippa beautifully sing a duet from "Don Giovanni" that perfectly describes their situation in the movie, you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film.  	positive
	Overall, I don't think that I would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that I silently felt too.	negative
	I'd say that would be the hardest decision... Honestly, all of M's dishes taste how they are supposed to taste (amazing).	positive
	The chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless, seemed thin and watered down with no heat.	negative
	I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.	positive
	This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	negative
	All of the tapas dishes were delicious!	positive
	Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.	negative
	I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.	positive
	I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	negative
	Cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable.	positive
	This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	negative
	This is the number one best TH game in the series.  	positive
	The movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy.  	negative
	Well packaged, arrived on time, and works as intended.	positive
	If there were zero stars I would give it zero stars.	negative
	All in all, I can assure you I'll be back.	positive
	Not my thing.	negative
	I could care less... The interior is just beautiful.	positive
	No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts.	negative
	My headset works just peachy-keen.	positive
	Not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom.	negative
	But it is entertaining, nonetheless.  	positive
	I just wanted to leave.	negative
	Food was great and so was the serivce!	positive
	But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	negative
	This place is great!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	positive
	It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.	negative
	A good commentary of today's love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing.  	positive
	The Foreigner is not worth one second of your time.  	negative
	Both do good jobs and are quite amusing.  	positive
	The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.	negative
	Definitely worth checking out.  	positive
	I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.	negative
	Good case!.	positive
	It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.	negative
	Just what I wanted.	positive
	It was extremely "crumby" and pretty tasteless.	negative
	Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	positive
	This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	negative
	It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	positive
	The service was meh.	negative
	Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	positive
	Was not happy.	negative
	Very wind-resistant.	positive
	Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it.	negative
	We had fantastic service, and were pleased by the atmosphere.	positive
	Just don't know why they were so slow.	negative
	The food was delicious, our bartender was attentive and personable AND we got a great deal!	positive
	Bad Purchase.	negative
	But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	positive
	WAAAAAAyyyyyyyyyy over rated is all I am saying.	negative
	The best phone in market :).	positive
	It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	negative
